## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for predicting the spread and impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We use data analysis and machine learning techniques to provide insights and predictions that can aid in decision-making and resource allocation during the ongoing pandemic.

## Key Features

- **Data Processing:** Scripts for cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming COVID-19 data from various sources.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Notebooks to explore trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of predictive models including regression, time series forecasting, and epidemiological models.
- **Visualization:** Visual representations of data and model outputs using matplotlib and seaborn.
- **Deployment:** Instructions for deploying models for real-time prediction or scenario analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/corona-prediction.git
   cd corona-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. Download COVID-19 data from [source](link_to_data_source) and place it in the `data/` directory.

2. Run data preprocessing scripts:
   ```
   python data_preprocessing.py
   ```

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore the data using Jupyter notebooks:
   ```
   jupyter notebook exploratory_analysis.ipynb
   ```
